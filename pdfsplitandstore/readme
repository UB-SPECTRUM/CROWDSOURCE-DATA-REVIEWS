Splitting of the pdf is done using ILOVEPDF Developer API.
Need to install the dependency. Used composer for doing that.

Testing database it set up to check the functionality.

Code works as it splits the pdf and zips the splitted content which is inturn unzipped to a folder. 
The unzipped folder is scanned through for the split pdfs and all of them are uploaded into the database.

Tested and OK.

********* Constraints **********
API allows only 250 files for an individual user. Should go for premium for unlimited access.
Composer installation.
Created dummy database and php web view only for checking this functionality. Need to be integrated once the other parts are ready.
